# go-basespace

go-basespace is Go client library for interacting with the [BaseSpace API](https://developer.basespace.illumina.com/docs/content/documentation/rest-api/api-reference).
It is being developed in an effort to learn Go. *Note that go-basespace is very much a work in progress.*  

[go-github](https://github.com/google/go-github) provided inspiration for the design of the library.
